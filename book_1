4 The shop was owned by an old man named Elias Windcroft, a clockmaker with silver hair and eyes that always seemed to be counting something. He rarely spoke, and when he did, his words were deliberate and weighted, like he was always answering a question asked long ago. No one knew where Elias had come from, only that he had been in the town longer than most of its buildings.

22 Elias explained that time was not a straight line, but a loop — fragile, constantly wearing thin. The clocks in his shop weren’t just telling time — they were stitching it back together. And Model 103, the heart of the shop, had been failing. If it stopped entirely, people wouldn’t die — they’d forget. Whole histories, undone. People rewritten or erased. Reality would fold in places where the stitching came loose.

2 In the heart of a quiet town nestled between misty hills and dense woods, there stood a clock shop known to all but visited by few. Its windows were perpetually fogged, and the ticking inside could be heard from half a block away. Children would dare each other to press their noses to the glass, and the bolder ones would swear that the clocks inside didn’t all tick in unison — some even seemed to tick backward.
